Consequently, the first zero-crossing occurs later → larger τ.\n","\n","**This is a feature, not an artifact:**  \n","τ itself encodes pathophysiological information. Longer τ = slower autocorrelation\n","decay = reduced HRV = known arrhythmia precursor (Malik et al., 1996, Lancet).\n","The larger τ for crisis records is *independent corroborating evidence* of the\n","same physiological change that the β₁ collapse captures. Both point to the same\n","underlying loss of cardiac complexity before arrhythmia onset.\n","\n","**β₁ comparison validity:**  \n","Despite different τ values, the β₁ separation remains valid because:\n","1. Both use the same embedding dimension m=5 (validated via FNN < 1%, Cell 12)\n","2. Both use the same VietorisRips ε = median(death times), making scale relative\n","3.
